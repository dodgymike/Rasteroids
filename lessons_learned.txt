Lessons learned while playing with Gosu:
https://github.com/jlnr/gosu/wiki/Ruby-Tutorial
https://github.com/jlnr/gosu/wiki/Basic-Concepts
- c bindings
  - segfaults
  - image loading not reliable
- asteroids not appearing
  - don't forget to check the image rv
- images
  - Gimp 
    - use RGB bmp - jpg convertor doesn't work with transparent backgrounds

Chipmunk:
6.0.1
library install: http://wiki.slembcke.net/main/published/Chipmunk
ruby lib: https://github.com/jlnr/gosu/wiki/Ruby-Chipmunk-Integration
docs: http://files.slembcke.net/chipmunk/release/ChipmunkLatest-Docs/

  Ubuntu:
	install GLUT, libxmu, cmake
	- cmake .
	- hack Demo/Buoyancy.c line 132
	- sudo gem install chipmunk

- documentation for ruby bindings is not great
  - https://github.com/jlnr/gosu/blob/master/examples/ChipmunkIntegration.rb (for good examples of gosu/chipmunk integration)
  - look at c docs

- collisions
  - 'shapes' are crucial - define collision boundaries
  - circle 'shapes' are quite usable, poly 'shapes' require some thinking
  - don't forget to assign a shape 'type', otherwise collision functions won't work


General:
- pp is the enemy of performance
